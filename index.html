                <h1>about me</h1>
                <p>I'm a 14 year old Asian kiddo living in the UK who finally decided to create this place after much indecision and internal personal conflict. People call me smart, but I don't like to call myself that - that's my attempt at being humble, at least. I'll definitely attempt to prevent any arrogance from creeping in through the cracks in the walls here, that's for sure.<br/><br/>I have 2 achievements that I consider significant - learning calculus at around 12 years old, and being able to understand a necessary third (necessary for understanding some integration stuff) of mathematical analysis 3 - which is university 2nd year mathematics (if you consider those to be a cocky flexes then I don't what aren't, though there is a fine line between showing competence and skill over being conceited). I am currently partway through learning some linear algebra, and a CUDA parallel programming course to brush up programming skills after about 4 years of them being left to grow mouldy.<br/><br/>I also have a brother called Henry who's 21. He's a chill dude, and overall a great guy to be around.<br/><br/>Oh, and before you move on, my name is Kevin Jia.</p>
